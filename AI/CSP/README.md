This is a CSP folder where i solve problems using constraint programming

It contains a map coloring problem, and a suduko solver.

The sudoku solver can solve any valid sudoku, where you can manually enter the suduko.

I extended the functionallity with a ML approach to read a image of a suduko and then solve it using the CSP approach in this folder.

The extended project can be found in the Python folder as SudokuSolver
