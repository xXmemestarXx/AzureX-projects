# Personal Projects & CS Stuff

A collection of projects I've made in my free time – old school assignments, scripts, experiments, finished CS projects, and new ones I'm working on or planning.

There's no single theme – just a mix of different code. Some for fun, some for learning, some finished, and some that might grow into something bigger.

## Contents

- Old school projects  
- Scripts and utilities  
- Experiments and tests  
- Finished CS projects  
- New and upcoming CS projects  

Mainly for personal use, but maybe you'll find something useful or interesting.
